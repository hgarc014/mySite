            <h2>Hello, Welcome to my site!</h2>
            <p>My name is Henry and I am currently a student at University of California Riverside. I created this
                website in order to display my projects and stories.</p>

        <div class="backgroundGrayImg circle padAround" style="text-align:center">
            <h2>Yin and Yang</h2>
            <p>The image on the top right is a small version of a Yin and Yang image that I have created (you can click
                the image to see the large image).
                The image to me represents light and dark, good and bad.
                No matter how good a person is they always have tiny pieces of evil inside of them.
                Similarly, no matter how evil a person is they always have tiny pieces of good inside of them.
                However, a person themselves is not mearly one side of the image.
                They are 2 pieces, it's just a matter of which side of the image you are looking at.
